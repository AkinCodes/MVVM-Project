# MVVM-Project
This is an MVVM project where I am showcasing the MVVM structure of separating my files into the Model, View and View Model structure. This project is basically a call to a dummy class that fetches data and populates a table on screen. Additionally I have also made use of NavigationViews, Lists and NavigationLinks.
